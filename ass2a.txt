Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that is widely used for tracking changes 
in source code during software development. It allows multiple developers to collaborate 
on projects simultaneously. Git tracks changes to files, which allows developers to revert 
to previous versions, compare changes over time, and merge changes made by different people.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform built around Git. It provides a 
centralized location for hosting Git repositories, along with additional features 
such as issue tracking, project management, and code review tools. GitHub allows 
developers to collaborate on projects, share code with others, and contribute to open-source projects.
